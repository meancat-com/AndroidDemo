# AndroidDemo
Unity Android Demo that uses touch screen and also new UI elements.

This uses the New Input System to do enhanced touch screen, though it doesn't
actually do anything all that enhanced.

Clicking or tapping the screen creates a small image on the canvas.
Clicking the button works too, but currently ALSO creates a small image -
I have yet to figure out how to get the button click to work, without
also triggering a 'tap performed'. It's probably something really simple.
